      "While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data.

      "]\n",
      "AI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.\n",
      "[\n",
      "150\n",
      "]\n",
      "Notably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms.\n",

      "Selection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias—that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as “A”) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model’s performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.\n",

       "# Summary of the \"Large Language Model\" Wikipedia Page\n",
       "\n",
       "The Wikipedia page on Large Language Models (LLMs) provides an extensive overview of this class of machine learning models specifically designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. LLMs are characterized by their capacity to generate human-like text, relying heavily on a vast amount of training data processed via self-supervised learning methods. The most advanced LLMs are typically based on transformer architectures.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Sections Covered:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **History**: The section discusses the evolution of LLMs from early statistical models in the 1990s to the advent of neural networks and the transformer architecture in 2017. It highlights milestones like BERT and the progression to models like GPT-2 and GPT-3, culminating with the introduction of GPT-4 and its multimodal capabilities by OpenAI.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Dataset Preprocessing**: This part focuses on the steps involved in preparing datasets for training, including tokenization (with methods like Byte Pair Encoding), cleaning to remove low-quality or toxic data, and the use of synthetic data when necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Training and Architecture**: This section details various techniques used for training LLMs, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), instruction tuning, and the mixture of experts approach. It also discusses the complexity of infrastructure required for training large models.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Properties and Capabilities**: It explores the emergent abilities that larger models exhibit, such as in-context learning and scaling laws that predict performance based on parameters and dataset size.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Evaluation**: The evaluation methods for LLMs are reviewed, focusing on perplexity, benchmarks, and the limitations of existing metrics.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Wider Impact**: This segment outlines the potential societal implications of LLMs, including concerns over copyright, misinformation, algorithmic bias, and their environmental impact due to energy demands.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recent Developments:\n",
       "- A notable announcement in late 2024 discussed the emergence of reasoning models, specifically mentioning OpenAI's o1 model that shows improvements in structured problem-solving compared to traditional LLMs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the Wikipedia page serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding large language models, their historical development, underlying technologies, evaluative metrics, and their societal implications."
